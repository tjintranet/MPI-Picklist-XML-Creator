# Master ID Search & PDF/XML Generator with Duplicate Detection

A web application that searches for Master IDs in a JSON database and generates downloadable PDF reports and individual XML files with detailed product information. Features both single Master ID lookup and bulk CSV file processing with automatic grouping by paper type, alphabetical sorting by Master ID, automatic work date extraction from CSV data, **duplicate Master ID detection with quantity consolidation**, and clean user interface with automatic status message management.

## Overview

This application allows users to quickly lookup individual Master IDs or upload CSV files containing multiple Master IDs, automatically searches for matches in a JSON database, **detects and consolidates duplicate Master Order IDs by summing their quantities**, and generates professional PDF reports grouped by paper type with Master IDs sorted alphabetically within each group, or individual XML files named by ISBN. The work date is automatically extracted from the CSV file, and missing Master IDs are clearly identified in both the interface and output files. The interface features automatic cleanup of status messages for a streamlined user experience.
