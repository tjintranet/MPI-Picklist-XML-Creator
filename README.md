# Master ID Search & PDF/XML Generator with Duplicate Detection & MPI Filtering

A web application that searches for Master IDs in a JSON database and generates downloadable PDF reports and individual XML files with detailed product information. Features both single Master ID lookup and bulk CSV/Excel file processing with automatic grouping by paper type, alphabetical sorting by Master ID, automatic work date extraction from CSV data, **duplicate Master ID detection with quantity consolidation**, **MPI status filtering**, and clean user interface with automatic status message management.

## Overview

This application allows users to quickly lookup individual Master IDs or upload CSV/Excel files containing multiple Master IDs, automatically searches for matches in a JSON database, **detects and consolidates duplicate Master Order IDs by summing their quantities**, **filters results by MPI status**, and generates professional PDF reports grouped by paper type with Master IDs sorted alphabetically within each group, or individual XML files named by ISBN. The work date is automatically extracted from the CSV file, and missing Master IDs are clearly identified in both the interface and output files.

## Key Features

- **Bulk CSV/Excel Processing**: Upload CSV (.csv) or Excel (.xlsx, .xls) files with Master IDs in column D, quantities in column B, and work dates in column C
- **ðŸ†• Duplicate Detection & Consolidation**: Automatically detects duplicate Master Order IDs and sums their quantities
- **ðŸ†• MPI Status Filtering**: Toggle to show only items with "MPI" status vs "Pod Ready" status
- **Automatic JSON Database Loading**: Loads `data.json` automatically from the same directory
- **File Upload Support**: Drag & drop or click to upload CSV and Excel files
- **Intelligent Sorting**: Results grouped by paper type with Master IDs sorted alphabetically within each group
- **Automatic Work Date Extraction**: Work date automatically extracted from column C of CSV file
- **Dual Export Options**:
  - **PDF Reports**: Clean, professional layout grouped by paper type with MPI filtering support
  - **XML Files**: Individual XML files per item, named by ISBN for automated processing
- **Missing ID Tracking**: Identifies and reports Master IDs not found in database
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Both PDF and XML exports include comprehensive data with duplicate indicators
- **Clean Interface**: Minimal, professional design with automatic status message cleanup

## File Structure

```
project-folder/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # Main HTML structure
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js               # JavaScript functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ data.json               # JSON database (your data)
â””â”€â”€ README.md              # This file
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download/Clone** all files to a directory on your web server or local machine
2. **Ensure JSON Database** is named exactly `data.json` and placed in the same directory as `index.html`
3. **Open** `index.html` in a web browser

## Usage

### CSV/Excel File Processing

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Data File
Create a CSV or Excel file with the following column structure:
- **Column A**: Title (or any data)
- **Column B**: Quantity/Remaining stock
- **Column C**: Work Date (automatically extracted for PDF header)
- **Column D**: Master Order ID

**Important Notes:**
- Master Order IDs must be in **column D** (4th column)
- Print quantities must be in **column B** (2nd column)  
- Work date must be in **column C** (3rd column)
- First row should be headers (will be automatically skipped)
- Save the file in CSV (.csv) or Excel (.xlsx, .xls) format

#### Step 2: Upload & Process
- Upload your file using drag & drop or the file browser
- The application automatically detects:
  - Master Order IDs from column D
  - Print quantities from column B
  - Work date from column C (uses first valid date found)
- Duplicate Master Order IDs are automatically consolidated with summed quantities
- View the search results grouped by paper type with Master Order IDs sorted alphabetically within each group

#### Step 3: Apply MPI Filter (Optional)
- Use the **MPI Only** toggle to filter results to show only items with "MPI" status
- MPI items are highlighted with yellow background and warning badges
- Filter statistics show how many items are displayed vs hidden
- Toggle can be switched on/off at any time without re-processing data

#### Step 4: Export Results

**Option A: Download PDF Report**
- Click "Download PDF" to generate a comprehensive report
- The PDF includes:
  - **Automatic Work Date Header**: Work date from CSV column C displayed as DD/MM/YY format
  - Summary with total searched, found, and missing counts
  - Missing Master Order IDs section (if any exist)
  - Results grouped by paper type with gray section headers
  - **Master IDs sorted alphabetically within each paper type group**
  - Complete product details including print quantities and status
  - Consolidated quantities marked with asterisk (*) and footnote
  - Clean, professional formatting optimized for A4 printing
  - **MPI Filtering**: When MPI filter is active, PDF shows "(MPI Only)" in title and contains only MPI items

**Option B: Download Individual XML Files**
- Click "Download XML" to generate individual XML files
- Creates one XML file per search result (respects MPI filter if active)
- Each file is named using the ISBN (e.g., `9781234567890.xml`)
- If ISBN is missing, falls back to Master Order ID with `_no_isbn` suffix
- All XML files are packaged in a single ZIP archive
- Perfect for automated processing systems
- **Filtered Exports**: When MPI filter is active, ZIP filename includes "MPI_" prefix

### Additional Features

- **Clear All**: Reset the entire application (clears both lookup and bulk results, resets filter)
- **Delete Individual Items**: Remove specific results from the display and exports
- **Delete Paper Type Sections**: Remove entire paper type groups at once
- **Automatic Header Detection**: CSV header row is automatically skipped
- **Automatic Status Cleanup**: Loading messages disappear once processing is complete
- **Automatic Date Extraction**: Work date automatically extracted from CSV data
- **Responsive Interface**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback for file format issues and missing data

## File Format Requirements

### CSV/Excel File Structure
The file should follow this exact column structure:

| Column A (Title) | Column B (Quantity) | Column C (Date) | Column D (Master Order ID) |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Book Title 1     | 500                 | 02/09/2025      | TCE104              |
| Book Title 2     | 1000                | 02/09/2025      | TCB056              |
| Book Title 3     | 250                 | 02/09/2025      | TCE105              |

**Format Notes:**
- First row (headers) is automatically skipped
- Empty rows are filtered out automatically
- File must be saved in supported format (.csv, .xlsx, .xls)
- If quantity is empty, it will show as '0'
- Work date is extracted from the first valid row in column C
- Date formats are automatically detected and parsed (DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### File Upload Issues
- Ensure file is in supported format (.csv, .xlsx, .xls)
- Check that Master Order IDs are in column D, quantities in column B, and dates in column C
- Verify CSV has proper column structure (4 columns minimum)
- Try re-saving the file if upload fails

### MPI Filter Issues
- **Toggle Not Working**: Refresh the page if toggle doesn't respond
- **No MPI Items**: Verify your data contains items with "MPI" status (case-insensitive)
- **Incorrect Filtering**: Check console (F12) for any JavaScript errors

### Export Problems
- **PDF Issues**: Ensure browser allows downloads and check for popup blockers
- **XML Issues**: Verify JSZip library loads properly; refresh page if needed
- **Large Datasets**: Try with smaller datasets if memory issues occur
- **Missing Filter Prefix**: Ensure MPI filter is active before downloading for "MPI_" prefix

### Date Processing Issues
- **No Date Found**: Ensure column C contains valid dates
- **Wrong Date Format**: Application handles most common formats automatically
- **Invalid Dates**: Check that dates are reasonable (not in distant past/future)
- **Missing Date Column**: Ensure CSV/Excel has at least 3 columns with date in column C
